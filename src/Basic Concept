Complexity

Time Complexity:
    Operations
    Comparisons
    Loop
    Pointer references
    function calls to outside

Space Complexity:
    Variable
    Data Structure
    Allocation
    Function call

somefunc(int x) /// the function call(M) and argument(N); looking at the memory
                /// the argument here would take memory to use
    int y = 5 /// declaration of a variable(P); connecting to the memory, so we ignore the
              /// operation of it when it charges its value
    y = 1 + 2 // constant O(1): A

    for (int i = 0; i < x; i ++) // n times: B  /// we don't count the for loop itself
        someother(); // n times: C
        int z = 9;                              /// we only care about this declaration(E)
        y ++; // n times: D

    return y

    Time Complexity:
        A + nB + nC + nD
        A + n(B + C + D)
        k1 + nk2
        O(n)

    Space Complexity:
        M + N + P + nE
        k1 + nk2
        O(n)
